# Ecosystem-Simulation
A small Ecosystem Interactive Simulator

WORK IN PROGRESS

# What is it?
This is a simple ecosystem simulator game. Designed with the intent of visualization, the game features many charachteristics that wouldn't be found in conventional simulators.

The simulation isn't the most efficient, and gets incredibly laggy. However, smaller sample sizes still function properly. Feel free to use this simulator as a visualizer to develop unique strategies to help these creatures grow and view adaption in real-time.

# How To Install

git clone or download the zip and open it in Unity.

Using Unity 2020.3.6f1

# Code Breakdown
## Creature
### Phenotype
Creatures have 5 main components attatched to their body: head, torso, legs, eyes and neck.
Each influence the capabilities of the creature and allow it to do specific things in various environmental pressures.

### Genotype
Behind the scene are a couple genes shown here:

These are the genes being directly manipulated by genetic mutation and sexual reproduction. Reproduction averages these genes, and while isn't the most realistic, I still get reasonably similar results. Genetic mutation chance and strength can be set in the UI.
## Plants
### Phenotype
Plants are directly composed of the genes that effect it. Meaning, that the plants are directly generated by the genes.
Each influence the capabilities of the plant and allow it to do specific things in various environmental pressures.

### Genotype
Behind the scene are a couple genes shown here:

Plants also have four distinct categories that they fit in: **Fruit, Hard, Toxic, and Flying**. <br />

**Flying Seeds** simulate seed dispersal through means of wind, thus, is easy to travel, but has lower survival rate. <br />
**Fruit and Toxic Seeds** simulate seed digestion through means of consumption by the creature. Toxic seeds have a chance of killing the creature. Fruits remain a symbiotic relationship between the plants and animals and can be used to create a balanced ecosystem. <br />
**Hard Seeds** simulate gymnosperm seeds with heavy protection. <br />
