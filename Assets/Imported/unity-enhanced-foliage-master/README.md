# unity-enhanced-foliage

A now outdated solution for foliage movement outside unity's terrain, I've taken the vertex movement part from [here](https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/shader-moving-trees-grass-in-wind-outside-of-terrain.230911/). Thanks, GambinoInd!

You can also control the behaviour of the movement by tweaking the values from "CustomWind", a script that must be
inside of any game object in your scene, works like a cheap wind zone. **Needs Blender for .blend models.**

Now I do have a solution for bark movement through vertex colors, not here yet, maybe in a new repository.
