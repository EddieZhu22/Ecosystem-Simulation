Thank you for downloading World Space Trees (Free version)

This system allows for variation based on placement via the shader.
With world space enable it will switch the texture quadrant of the leafs to an
adjacent one based on its position fraction.

You can toggle this feature in the materials.

New features (March 5th, 2019)

Better translucency control
Sun Down control (makes the colors darker based on the light position, great for day/night cycles)

Refined parameters.

Switched out the old shaders as they were created with Shader Forge and some features were not being supported.

When making your own textures, move them to each quadrant with the normal and translucency maps lined up.

Several versions and a demo video have been made, link on the Asset store page for this product.

Full version will have more updates and textures, if you want to support this pack to grow futher, please purchase it here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/world-space-trees-142096
